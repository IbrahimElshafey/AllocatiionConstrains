Find time slot counts
Compare((G1.length - G2.lenght)+ conflict count) = Compare(4-3,1)
If conflicts count == lenght difference >> no increase needed
Increase time slots by (conflicts count - lenght difference)

G1 = 7 TS (Time Slots)
G2 = 7 TS
G3 = 7 TS

G1,G2 Conflicts = 2,2 = 4
G1,G3 Conflicts = 1,3 = 4

G2,G3 Conflicts = 1 = 1

Distribution and Order Cosntrains will guide the selection of suitable slot
 Constrains Types
            - Intersection Constrain
                - Activities with tag/s must not overlapping
                - Activities with tag/s be in same time
            - Length Constrain
                - Fill two time slot (time length)
            - Order Constrain
                - Activity A2 must be after A1
                - Activity Ax can't start before/after time
            - Distribution Constrains
                - Activities with tag "Subject=Math,Group=Any" locate in the same time every day for the group
                - Activities with tag "Teacher1" spread over two days only
                - Activities with tag "Teacher1" must be separated by one hour at least
                - Time Preference Constrain
                    - Not available time slots per tag
                    - Priority>>Activities with the tag "Early=true" must fill slots 1-3
