         * we have list of time slots and another of activities

         * multiple activities can be placed in time slot
         * each activity has one or many tags

         * Constrain may be
         * - Static and not changed while solution running  
         * - Dynamic and changed based on the previous state
         * 
         * If we translate every constrain to a function that function will take (activities,time slots space) and return: 
         * - Time slots that can be used in allocation
         * - Activities that can be allocated

         * before any constrains applied the space available for any activity is (TimeSlot.Start,TimeSlot.End)

         * Static constrain is a function that return the same time slots and the same activity every time it called
         * Dynamic constrain is a function that changed based on previous allocation
         * Any constrain function return must be refined before the calculation

            Constrains Types
            - Intersection Constrain
                - Activities with tag/s must not overlapping
                - Activities with tag/s be in same time
            - Length Constrain
                - Fill two time slot (time length)
            - Order Constrain
                - Activity A2 must be after A1
            - Distribution Constrains
                - Activities with tag "Subject=Math,Group=Any" locate in the same time every day for the group
                - Activities with tag "Teacher1" spread over two days only
                - Activities with tag "Teacher1" must be separated by one hour at least
                - Time Preference Constrain
                    - Not available time slots per tag
                    - Priority>>Activities with the tag "Early=true" must fill slots 1-3
